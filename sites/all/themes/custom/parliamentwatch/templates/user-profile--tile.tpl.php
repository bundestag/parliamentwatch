/**
 * @file
 * Default theme implementation to present all user profile data.
 *
 * This template is used when viewing a registered member's profile page,
 * e.g., example.com/user/123. 123 being the users ID.
 *
 * Use render($user_profile) to print all profile items, or print a subset
 * such as render($user_profile['field_user_picture']). Always call
 * render($user_profile) at the end in order to print all remaining items. If
 * the item is a category, it will contain all its profile items. By default,
 * $user_profile['summary'] is provided, which contains data on the user's
 * history. Other data can be included by modules. $user_profile['user_picture']
 * is available for showing the account picture.
 *
 * Available variables:
 *   - $user_profile: An array of profile items. Use render() to print them.
 *   - $user_url: The URL to the detail page of the profile.
 *   - $display_name: The display name.
 *   - $field_user_picture: The profile picture.
 *   - $field_user_picture_copyright: The profile picture's copyright.
 *   - $field_user_constituency: The constituency.
 *   - $field_user_party: The party.
 *   - $questions: The number of questions the user has received.
 *   - $answers: The number of questions the user has answered.
 *   - $answer_ratio: The percentage of answered questions.
 *
 * @see user-profile-category.tpl.php

 *   Where the html is handled for each item in the group.
