# Parliamentwatch

## Getting started

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
1. Install [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)
1. `$ git clone -b develop git@github.com:parliamentwatch/parliamentwatch.git`
1. `$ cd parliamentwatch`
1. `$ export AW_USERNAME=... AW_PASSSWORD=...`
1. `$ vagrant up`
1. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

In case `vagrant up` exits with the error "No guest IP was given to the Vagrant core NFS helper...", run `vagrant reload --provision`.

## Vagrant

The virtual machine for local development is managed with Vagrant. There are two provisioners which are executed automatically when running `vagrant up` for the first time or when provisioning is requested explicitly. The *bootstrap* provisioner installs and configures the packages. The *database* provisioner downloads the latest backup from http://backups.parliamentwatch.org, loads it into the database and reverts the features. It needs HTTP Basic credentials in order to download the backup. Those can be exported to the shell:

    $ export AW_USERNAME=... AW_PASSWORD=...

Both provisioners can be executed by name:

    $ vagrant provision --provision-with bootstrap
    $ vagrant provision --provision-with database
